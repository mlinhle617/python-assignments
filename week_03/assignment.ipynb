      "The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,\n",
      "It isn’t just one of your holiday games;\n",
      "You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter\n",
      "When I tell you, a cat must have 3 DIFFERENT NAMES.\n",
      "First of all, there’s the name that the family use daily,\n",
      "Such as \n",
      "Peter, \n",
      "Augustus, \n",
      "Alonzo, \n",
      "James, \n",
      "Such as Victor or Jonathan, George or Bill Bailey—\n",
      "All of them sensible everyday names.\n",
      "There are fancier names if you think they sound sweeter,\n",
      "Some for the gentlemen, some for the dames:\n",
      "Such as Plato, Admetus, Electra, Demeter—\n",
      "['But', 'all', 'of', 'them', 'sensible', 'everyday', 'names,']\n",
      "But I tell you, a cat needs a name that’s particular,\n",
      "A name that’s peculiar, and more dignified,\n",
      "Else how can he keep up his tail perpendicular,\n",
      "Or spread out his whiskers, or cherish his pride?\n",
      "Of names of this kind, I can give you a quorum,\n",
      "Such as Munkustrap, Quaxo, or Coricopat, \n",
      "Such as Bombalurina, or else \n",
      "Jellylorum—\n",
      "Names that never belong to more than one cat.\n",
      "But above and beyond there’s still one name left over,\n",
      "And that is the name that you never will guess;\n",
      "The name that no human research can discover—\n",
      "But THE CAT HIMSELF KNOWS, and will never confess.\n",
      "When you notice a cat in profound meditation,\n",
      "The reason, I tell you, is always the same:\n",
      "His mind is engaged in a rapt contemplation\n",
      "Of the thought, of the thought, of the thought of his name:\n",
